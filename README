Apache::TimedRedirect is a mod_perl TransHandler module that allows the
configuration of a timed redirect. In other words if someone enters a
a website  and the URI matches a regex AND it is within a
certain time period they will be redirected somewhere else.

It was first created to 'politely' redirect visitors away from database
driven sections of a website while the databases were being refreshed.

This software requires that Time::Period (CPAN) be installed on the target system.

This software is considered beta please use with the usual caution.
